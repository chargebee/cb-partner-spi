# Einvoicing SPI Integration

Chargebee streamlines e-invoicing compliance across regions by facilitating the following operations throughout the billing lifecycle:

## Retrieve E-invoicing Activations

- Retrieves the list of country and network activations that are configured in the connected e-invoicing provider platform.
- Each activation reflects a country and e-invoicing network made available by the provider.
- Chargebee uses this operation during provider enablement to determine which activations can be offered to merchants.

## Document Submission

- Submits invoices and credit notes to external e-invoicing systems for validation, compliance processing, and delivery to tax authorities or trading partners.

## Status Tracking

- Provides real-time tracking of the processing status of submitted documents, including states such as `accepted`, `in_progress`, `successful`, and `failed`.

## Final Document Retrieval

- Retrieves finalized and regulator-approved documents for archiving, auditing, or customer-facing use.

Chargebee leverages external e-invoicing services to execute these operations effectively. These services are certified vendors offering APIs to manage e-invoicing compliance and document exchange with tax authorities.

## The Role of the E-invoicing Adapter App

To connect with external e-invoicing systems, Chargebee uses an **E-invoicing Adapter App** â€” a bridge that enables secure and standardized communication between Chargebee and the e-invoicing system.

This communication is governed by the **E-invoicing Service Provider Interface (SPI)**.

# Building an E-invoicing Adapter App

To integrate an e-invoicing system with Chargebee, you must implement the E-invoicing SPI by developing an adapter app. This is required in the following scenarios:

### As an E-invoicing Provider

Connect your compliance platform to Chargebee so merchants can automatically submit billing documents in a regulator-approved format.

### As a System Integrator

Build a connector that bridges a third-party e-invoicing provider and Chargebee, enabling seamless integration for merchants.

By implementing the E-invoicing SPI, you enable Chargebee to support **global regulatory compliance** through a **scalable and region-agnostic architecture**.
