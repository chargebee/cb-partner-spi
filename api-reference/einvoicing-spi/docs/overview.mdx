    The E-invoicing Service Provider Interface (SPI) defines the standard contract that enables Chargebee to seamlessly integrate with third-party e-invoicing providers across different countries and compliance frameworks.
    
    Through this SPI, providers expose a minimal yet powerful set of APIs that allow Chargebee to submit billing documents (invoices, credit notes), track their compliance status, and retrieve finalized documents securely.
    
    This framework ensures that Chargebee merchants remain compliant with diverse global e-invoicing mandates by abstracting the complexity of country-specific regulatory requirements.
    
    ## Supported Capabilities
    
    - Retrieve supported country and network activations for e-invoicing enablement.
    - Submit billing documents for validation, compliance checks, and delivery to tax authorities or trading partners.
    - Track the processing status of submitted documents, including success, failure, or in-progress states.
    - Retrieve finalized e-invoicing documents for storage, audit, or customer presentation.
    
    ## Global Compliance Expansion
    
    The Chargebee E-invoicing SPI is designed to support multiple e-invoicing compliance models globally, including clearance models, post-audit models, and hybrid frameworks, helping businesses scale their operations across different regulatory landscapes without friction.
