## Overview
Chargebee uses [**HTTP header-based authorization**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7235) for all SPI endpoints related to the Service Adapter. This approach ensures secure and dynamic management of authorization credentials during SPI interactions.

## How It Works
- The **Authorization Key** for API calls is dynamically passed in the HTTP header, enabling secure and seamless integration.
- This key is defined in the [JSON Schema](https://github.com/chargebee/cb-partner-spi/tree/einvoicing_spi_phase2/spec/capabilities), which must be completed and submitted by the partner during the app registration process in Chargebeeâ€™s Marketplace.
- During the application onboarding process in Chargebee, merchants provide the necessary authorization parameter values.
- The Chargebee application uses these values to authenticate and make API calls to the Service Adapter.


## Structure of `credential_configuration`
- The `credential_configuration` is an array of objects, where each object represents a credential parameter.
- Each object includes the following attributes:
    - **`id`**: A unique identifier for the credential. For example, `authorization_key` or `client_secret`.
    - **`name`**: A descriptive label of the credential.
    - **`type`**:The credential type. For example, `text`.
    - **`is_sensitive`**: Indicates whether the credential is sensitive.

## JSON Configuration Example

```json
{
  "api_configuration": {
    "api_base_url": "https://chargebee.partnerX.com/v1",
    "credential_configuration": [ 
      {
        "id": "api_key",
        "name": "API Key", 
        "type": "text",
        "is_sensitive": true 
      },
      {
        "id": "company_code",
        "name": "Company code",
        "type": "text",
        "is_sensitive": false
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Authorization Header

Below is the structure of authorization header that will be passed from Chargebee app to Service Adapter. Some of the 
parameters are sent by default by Chargebee as mentioned in the example below:

```json
{
--header 'Authorization: 
{
  "api_key": "api_keyX", 
  "merchant_id": "merchant_id_partnerX", //sent by Chargebee by default
  "company_code": "company_code_partnerX", //sent by Chargebee by default
  "trace_id": "12345-abcde-67890" //sent by Chargebee by default
}
'
}
