# Tax SPI Integration

Chargebee simplifies tax management during checkout sessions and invoice generation throughout the subscription lifecycle by performing the following operations:

### 1. Validating Customer Shipping Address
Validates shipping addresses to ensure accurate tax calculation and product delivery.

### 2. Tax Estimation
Calculates applicable taxes for invoices and their line items.

### 3. Tax Reconciliation
Submits invoice and credit note data to external systems for tax reconciliation.

Chargebee leverages external tax services to execute these operations effectively. These services can be categorized as:

- **Third-Party Tax Service Providers:**  
  APIs provided by third-party tax service vendors for tax calculation and reconciliation.

- **Merchant's In-House Tax Software:**  
  Custom-built tax management solutions used internally by merchants.

## The Role of the Tax Service Adapter App

To connect with external tax services, Chargebee requires a tax service adapter—a bridge facilitating seamless communication between Chargebee and the tax service. This connection is established using the **Tax Service Provider Interface (SPI)**.

## Building a Tax Service Adapter App

To integrate a tax service with Chargebee, you must implement the Tax SPI (you can refer the spec file for this spi [here](https://github.com/cb-suryak/cb-partner-mintlify-spi/blob/main/spec/spi/openapi_tax.yml)) by developing a tax service adapter app. This is essential for one of the following scenarios:

- **As a Tax Service Provider:**  
  Connect your tax service with Chargebee to provide seamless tax calculation capabilities to merchants.

- **As a Merchant:**  
  Connect your in-house tax software to Chargebee for tailored tax management.

- **As a System Integrator:**  
  Develop a connector to bridge a tax service provider and Chargebee, enabling integration for merchants.

By implementing the Tax SPI, you enable Chargebee to perform tax-related operations efficiently, ensuring accurate compliance and streamlined workflows.

## JSON Schema for Tax Provider


JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, text-based format commonly used to transmit data between web applications and servers. It is both human-readable and machine-parsable.

JSON Schema, a standard established by the [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04#:~:text=JSON%20Schema%20is%20a%20JSON,interaction%20control%20of%20JSON%20data), defines the structure and constraints of a JSON document. It describes the expected properties, data types, and rules for interacting with JSON data, ensuring consistency and validity.

Below is the Chargebee Tax Provider JSON Schema. Using this schema ensures that your tax provider data is structured accurately and complies with Chargebee’s platform requirements. This improves data consistency and simplifies integration with other systems or applications.
