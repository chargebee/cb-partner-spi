The `trace_id` included in the Authorization header is a unique identifier that helps track API requests across systems. It's a valuable tool for troubleshooting issues such as failed requests, authentication errors, or slow responses.

### How to Use `trace_id` for Troubleshooting:

1. **Locate the `trace_id`:**  
The `trace_id` is found in the Authorization header of the API request, for example:
```json
{
--header 'Authorization: 
{
  "api_key": "api_keyX",
  "merchant_id": "merchant_id_partnerX", //sent by Chargebee by default
  "company_code": "company_code_partnerX", //sent by Chargebee by default
  "trace_id": "12345-abcde-67890" //sent by Chargebee by default
}
'
}
```
2. **Track Requests Across Systems:** 
Use the trace_id to trace the request through your logs and identify where issues may have occurred such as:
- Incoming requests.
- Internal processing layers.
- Outgoing requests to Chargebee.

Check log entries matching the trace_id to identify where the issue occurred (e.g., at the partner's system, Chargebee, or during data transmission).

3. **Common Issues to Troubleshoot:** 
- Authentication Errors (401/403): Verify api_key and merchant_id.
- Data Mismatches: Trace the request to spot discrepancies.
- Timeouts or Slow Responses: Use the trace_id to identify bottlenecks.

4. **Collaborate with Chargebee Using `trace_id`:**

-When an Issue Occurs:
If a request fails or behaves unexpectedly, share the trace_id with Chargebee's support team. This helps them identify the exact request and investigate the root cause efficiently.

-Chargebee to Partner:
Chargebee may also use the trace_id to notify partners of failures or unexpected behaviors in the partnerâ€™s system.
