# Tax SPI Integration

Chargebee simplifies tax management during checkout sessions and invoice generation throughout the subscription lifecycle by performing the following operations:

### 1. Validating Customer Shipping Address
Validates shipping addresses to ensure accurate tax calculation and product delivery.

### 2. Tax Estimation
Calculates applicable taxes for invoices and their line items.

### 3. Tax Reconciliation
Submits invoice and credit note data to external systems for tax reconciliation.

Chargebee leverages external tax services to execute these operations effectively. These services can be categorized as:

- **Third-Party Tax Service Providers:**  
  APIs provided by third-party tax service vendors for tax calculation and reconciliation.

- **Merchant's In-House Tax Software:**  
  Custom-built tax management solutions used internally by merchants.

## The Role of the Tax Service Adapter App

To connect with external tax services, Chargebee requires a tax service adapterâ€”a bridge facilitating seamless communication between Chargebee and the tax service. This connection is established using the **Tax Service Provider Interface (SPI)**.

## Building a Tax Service Adapter App

To integrate a tax service with Chargebee, you must implement the Tax SPI (you can refer the spec file for this spi [here](https://github.com/chargebee/cb-partner-spi/blob/main/spec/spi/openapi_tax.yml)) by developing a tax service adapter app. This is essential for one of the following scenarios:

- **As a Tax Service Provider:**  
  Connect your tax service with Chargebee to provide seamless tax calculation capabilities to merchants.

- **As a Merchant:**  
  Connect your in-house tax software to Chargebee for tailored tax management.

- **As a System Integrator:**  
  Develop a connector to bridge a tax service provider and Chargebee, enabling integration for merchants.

By implementing the Tax SPI, you enable Chargebee to perform tax-related operations efficiently, ensuring accurate compliance and streamlined workflows.
