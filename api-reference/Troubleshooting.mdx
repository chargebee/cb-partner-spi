The `trace_id` included in the Authorization header is a unique identifier that helps track API requests across systems. It's a valuable tool for troubleshooting issues such as failed requests, authentication errors, or slow responses.

### How to Use `trace_id` for Troubleshooting:

1. **Locate the `trace_id`:**  
The `trace_id` is found in the Authorization header of the API request, for example:
```json
{
--header 'Authorization: 
{
  "api_key": "client_id_partnerX", 
  "merchant_id": "merchant_id_partnerX", //sent by Chargebee by default
  "company_code": "company_code_partnerX", //sent by Chargebee by default
  "trace_id": "12345-abcde-67890" //sent by Chargebee by default
}
'
}
```
2. **Track Requests Across Systems:** 
Use the trace_id to trace the request through your logs and identify where issues may have occurred.

3. **Common Issues to Troubleshoot:** 
- Authentication Errors (401/403): Verify api_key and merchant_id.
- Data Mismatches: Trace the request to spot discrepancies.
- Timeouts or Slow Responses: Use the trace_id to identify bottlenecks.
