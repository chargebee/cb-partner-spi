## Updating & Using Postman Collection

- Postman test suites comprising test cases for each SPI endpoint is available in the `postman/<capability_name>` directory.  
  **Example:** `postman/tax`.

- Any changes made to the OpenAPI specification **MUST** be accompanied by adding or updating the corresponding test cases in the Postman collection.

- To test the SPI endpoints, import the Postman collection into your Postman workspace or Chargebee workspace.([Attach link here - TBA])
