    ## E-invoicing Service Provider Interface (SPI) — Overview
      Chargebee streamlines e-invoicing compliance across regions by facilitating the following operations throughout the billing lifecycle.
    
    - Retrieve E-invoicing Activations:
        - Retrieves the list of country and network activations that are configured in the connected e-invoicing provider platform.
        - Each activation reflects a country and e-invoicing network that has been set up and made available by the provider.
        - Chargebee uses this operation during provider enablement to determine which activations can be offered to merchants.
    - Document Submission:
       - Submits invoices and credit notes to external e-invoicing systems for validation, compliance processing, and delivery to tax authorities or trading partners.
    - Status Tracking:
       - Tracks the real-time processing status of submitted documents whether accepted, successful, failed, or still in progress.
    - Final Document Retrieval:
       - Retrieves finalized and regulator-approved documents for archiving, auditing or customer-facing use.

    Chargebee leverages external e-invoicing services to execute these operations effectively. These external e-invoicing servies are the  certified vendors offering APIs to handle e-invoicing compliance and document exchange with tax authorities.
    
    
    ## The Role of the E-invoicing Adapter App:
      - To connect with external e-invoicing systems, Chargebee uses an E-invoicing Adapter App — a bridge that enables secure and standardized communication between Chargebee and the e-invoicing system. This communication is governed by the E-invoicing Service Provider Interface (SPI).

    ## Building an E-invoicing Adapter App
      To integrate an e-invoicing system with Chargebee, you must implement the E-invoicing SPI by developing an adapter app. This is required in the following scenarios:
    
      - As an E-invoicing Provider:
        - Connect your compliance platform to Chargebee so merchants can automatically submit billing documents in a regulator-approved format.
      - As a System Integrator:
          description: Build a connector that bridges a third-party e-invoicing provider and Chargebee, enabling seamless integration for merchants.

    By implementing the E-invoicing SPI, you enable Chargebee to support global regulatory compliance through a scalable and region-agnostic architecture.

        Retrieves the list of country-level e-invoicing activations supported by the connected e-invoicing provider.
        
        Each activation represents the provider's capability to support e-invoicing in a specific country and network.
        
        This endpoint helps Chargebee determine which countries and e-invoicing networks can be activated for the provider.
        
        In Chargebee, this endpoint is called during the provider configuration for a specific country. It retrieves the activations that are already set up or in progress in the provider’s platform, helping users understand the available or pending e-invoicing capabilities.

      description: |
        This webhook endpoint is invoked by the e-invoicing adapter application once a document (invoice or credit note) has been processed, provided that Chargebee has whitelisted the adapter's IP address.

        The payload includes the unique document identifier and the final status of the document submission, such as SUBMITTED, ACCEPTED, REJECTED, or FAILED.

        Chargebee will primarily rely on this webhook endpoint to update the internal document tracking state and trigger downstream workflows (e.g., customer notifications, audit logs).

        This endpoint is idempotent. Repeated submissions with the same document identifier and status will not result in duplicate processing.

        a fallback mechanism to ensure status synchronization.
